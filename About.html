       <h2 class="h2"> What Is Random Number Guessing Game ? </h2>
       <p> I will explain it in context of computer and a person. </p>
       <div>
           <ul>
               <li> In this game, two players are required. </li>
               <li> The first player(computer) generates a random number within a given range and the other player(person/user) has to guess that number. </li>
               <li> If the guessed number doesn"t match with the random number then the player is given various hints i.e the guess is too low, try a higher number or guess is too high, try a lower number etc. </li> 
               <li> The player will keep guessing numbers until he/she finds the correct random number, while still being given hints.</li>
               <li> Eventually, the user guesses the correct number, and this way the game will end. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
