    <p>The computer will choose any random number between 1 and the range you have specified. 
        So you will specify the end of the range maybe 10, 20, 100, 1000 etc.</p> 
    <p> Then the you will try to guess the right number. </p>
    <p>If the user failed to enter the random number chosen by the computer then the user will get a hint.</p>
    <p>The <strong>hints </strong> will be like these:
        <ul>
            <li>Your guess was low, please enter a higher number.</li>
            <li>Your guess was high, please enter a lower number</li>
            <li>The comp_number is a multiple of  2</li>
            <li>The comp_number is a multiple of  3</li>
            <li>The comp_number is a multiple of  5</li>
        </ul>   
    </p> 
        <p>  
        With the help of these hints, you have to find the random number choosen by the computer.</p>
        
        <p>When you will enter the right random number chosen by the computer you will get an output like this:
        <br> <strong>Yeah you\'ve got it, this is your score</strong> </p>
